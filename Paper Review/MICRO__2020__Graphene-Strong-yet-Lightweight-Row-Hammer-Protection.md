# Paper content

## Summary

This paper proposes a low-cost counter-based RowHammer prevention called Graphene (strong yet lightweight as Graphene, an atomic-scale hexagonal lattice made of carbon atoms) on the basis of Misra-Gries algorithm, a classic, space-efficient solution to identify frequent elements from an incoming data stream. Graphene is deployed inside a memory controller
