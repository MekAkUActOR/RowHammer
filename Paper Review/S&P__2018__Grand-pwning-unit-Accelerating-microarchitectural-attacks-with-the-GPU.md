# Paper content

## Summary

This paper is the first work reverse engineering the caching hierarchy of the integrated GPU architecture and the first work realizing an end-to-end remote timing side channel and RowHammer attacks on mobile platforms from integrated GPU in Javascript, using the standardized WebGL API.

With the processor chip scaling, to improve the efficacy as well as maintain the same power consumption, processor vendors intend to add more specialized units s
